# codSoftTask-3
I recently developed a simple calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project includes basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

The HTML provides the structure, including the display and buttons for digits and operations. CSS is used to style the calculator, giving it a colorful and user-friendly interface. JavaScript handles the functionality, allowing users to input numbers, perform calculations, and see results in real-time.
